# Fullstack Assessment

This assessment is designed to measure your competence in:

- Ability to quickly understand and adapt to unfamiliar codebases
- Implementing new features using technologies you may not have worked with before
- Navigating unclear requirements and making tradeoffs
- Communicating your thought process

You are not expected to finish everything. **Completion is not the goal.** What matters is how you reason about the requirements, prioritize, and implement solutions.

# Requirements

You are building out the Residents Management portion of an assisted living facility’s electronic health records system. You will be given a working API and frontend scaffold. Your task is to extend both. You can use anything that you find helpful to complete this task including AI.

## Residents List Page

Create a page that retrieves data from the `/residents` API and displays it in a table.

- Full name
- Picture
- Age in years
- Gender
- Room number
- Days in facility

The API returns a large dataset. You are free to decide how the frontend should handle and display it in a way that remains responsive and usable.

## Usability & Performance

As you implement the Residents List Page, consider:

- How should the UI behave when the dataset is very large?
- How should users navigate, search, or organize results?
- How should the application remain performant when rendering large amounts of data?

There is no single right answer. We are interested in your reasoning and the tradeoffs you make.

# How to Run the Application

```bash
$ npm start # installs all dependencies and runs both the frontend and backend simultaneously
```

## Frontend — GET http://localhost:3001

A Hello World frontend is provided for you to get started.

## API — GET http://localhost:3000/residents
